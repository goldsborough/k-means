This repository contains code referenced in my blog post [Exploring k-means in Python, C++ and
CUDA], where I implement k-means in a variety of platforms. In this post I show how CUDA
implementations of k-means can outperform scikit-learn and scipy in performance by a factor of 72
and 90, respectively.

The code is not particularly tidy, but give an idea of how to implement k-means efficiently.

## Contents

- `python/` contains Python code to create toy clusters as well as run k-means using scikit-learn,
scipy and our roll-it-yourself implementation.
- `cpp/` contains C++ implementations of k-means, including one using Eigen.
- `cuda/` holds all CUDA implementations.
